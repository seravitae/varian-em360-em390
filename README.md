Archive of Varian EM-360/EM-390 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) Spectrometers + FT-NMR Upgrades

This is a respository for the ancient Varian EM-360/EM-390 60MHz and 90MHz permanent magnet nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers.

This repository aims to collect/develop data sets such as:
- Official documentation, instruction manuals, circuit diagrams, repair sheets, etc
- Processes/videos for common tasks such as probe removal, cleaning, shimming
- Unofficial upgrades such as replacement of the power/observe/plot console to a digital computer based system, and fourier transform upgrade (FT-NMR)
