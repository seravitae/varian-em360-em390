Archive of Varian EM-360/EM-390 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) Spectrometers + FT-NMR Upgrades

This is a respository for the ancient Varian EM-360 / EM-390 60MHz and 90MHz permanent magnet nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers.

To contribute to this project, contact me on discord (seravitae) or raise an issue with some way to contact you and what you can contribute.

This repository aims to collect/develop data sets such as:
- Official documentation, instruction manuals, circuit diagrams, repair sheets, etc
- Processes/videos for common tasks such as probe removal, cleaning, shimming
- Unofficial upgrades such as replacement of the power/observe/plot console to a digital computer based system, and fourier transform upgrade (FT-NMR)
