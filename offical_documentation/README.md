Please find official documentation as obtained.

Note that the EM-360 and EM-390 are very similar machines, and the EM-390 manual can for all intents and purposes be used for the EM-360 machine.

Given that my original manual is over 40 years old it was faded and yellow, I have done my best to restore the documents.

If you want to have a go at restoring the document, contact me for the original/raw scans and you may have better luck.
